Scaffolding for creating typescript definitions for Recurly.js

Running `npm run defs` will compile types on watch mode and output a single declaration `index.ts` file inside `/dist`

The `/test` directory is a sample app set to pull in types from `dist` for testing. It can also be run and built with `npm start` if needed
